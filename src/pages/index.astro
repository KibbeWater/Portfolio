                    I‚Äôm a {year - birthyear}-year-old student from Sweden. I‚Äôm
                    passionate about Software/Web Development and other
                    electronics.
                    <br /><br />
                    I‚Äôve been coding since the 5th grade, which is about {
                        year - startYear
                    } years ago. I started with Unity and Game Development, where
                    I learned C#. This sparked my long coding journey. Now, I‚Äôm self-taught
                    in JavaScript/TypeScript, C#, C/C++, Lua, and PHP. I‚Äôm also currently
                    exploring web frameworks, particularly React.js and Next.js.
                    <br /><br />
                    As a kid, I was always fascinated by computers. I spent countless
                    hours learning how to work them. I was often the ‚ÄúIT kid‚Äù who
                    helped others with computer issues at school. Around the 4th
                    grade, I joined a tech club where we did basic coding on a programmable
                    chip called a ‚ÄúCodeBug.‚Äù It was like a fun and interactive way
                    to learn programming for younger audiences. However, I eventually
                    stopped attending the club because it wasn‚Äôt very engaging.
                    <br /><br />
                    A year or two later, I decided to dive deeper into coding and
                    started using Unity to create several hobby projects. I continued
                    learning Unity until the 7th grade when I decided to branch out
                    and create software that could solve specific problems I faced.
                    <br /><br />
                    In the following year, I expanded my language skills to include
                    PHP and Lua. I started working on hobby projects in PHP and eventually
                    created my first website. During this time, I also learned Lua,
                    which I continued to work with for several years. I even started
                    selling LUA scripts as a source of income. I won‚Äôt disclose the
                    specifics of my creations, but you can likely find them by searching
                    for my name online.
                    <br /><br />
                    I continued this journey for another two years, where I delved
                    into C/C++ and JavaScript. In my first year of high school, I
                    embarked on a new adventure by reverse engineering software and
                    coding in C/C++. This led me to explore game hacking and reversing
                    using mostly static analysis tools. After completing the first
                    term of my first year, I embarked on a journey to learn JavaScript,
                    driven by my passion for modern web development. I quickly discovered
                    React.js and Next.js, which ignited my enthusiasm to create test
                    websites. Additionally, I delved into backend development and
                    other related concepts. This is where I currently stand, working
                    part-time as a Web Developer for an agency while simultaneously
                    pursuing personal projects.
