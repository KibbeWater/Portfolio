                    I‚Äôm a {year - birthYear}-year-old Swedish student passionate
                    about Software/Web Development and electronics.
                    <br /><br />
                    I‚Äôve been coding since the 5th grade, about {
                        year - startYear
                    } years ago. My journey began with Unity and Game Development,
                    where I learned C#. This sparked my interest in coding and led
                    me to become self-taught in JavaScript/TypeScript, C#, C/C++,
                    Lua, and PHP. I‚Äôm currently exploring web frameworks, particularly
                    React.js and Next.js.
                    <br /><br />
                    I‚Äôve always been fascinated by computers. I spent a lot of time
                    learning how to use them and often helped my classmates with
                    computer problems. In fourth grade, I joined a tech club where
                    we used a programmable chip called a ‚ÄúCodeBug‚Äù to do basic coding
                    exercises. It was a fun and interactive way to learn about programming,
                    but I eventually stopped going because it wasn‚Äôt very engaging.
                    <br /><br />
                    A year or two later, I decided to delve deeper into coding and
                    started using Unity to create several hobby projects. I continued
                    learning Unity until the 7th grade when I decided to branch out
                    and create software that could solve specific problems I faced.
                    <br /><br />
                    In the following year, I expanded my language skills to include
                    PHP and Lua. I began working on hobby projects in PHP and eventually
                    created my first website. During this period, I also learned
                    Lua, which I continued to work with for several years. I even
                    ventured into selling LUA scripts as a source of income, though
                    I won‚Äôt disclose the specifics of my creations. You can likely
                    find them by searching for my name online.
                    <br /><br />
                    For two more years, I kept learning and trying new things with
                    C/C++ and JavaScript. In my first year of high school, I started
                    reverse engineering software and coding in C/C++. It was like
                    solving a puzzle, and I loved it! This made me want to hack games
                    and reverse engineer them, mostly using static analysis tools.
                    After the first term, I decided to learn JavaScript because I
                    was really interested in modern web development. I quickly found
                    React.js and Next.js, and I couldn‚Äôt wait to build test websites.
                    I also looked at backend development and other related areas.
                    That‚Äôs where I am now, working part-time as a Web Developer for
                    an agency while also working on my own personal projects.

                        Skippy, a Safari extension, automatically seeks past ads.
                        Unlike other adblockers, it acts like an ad skipper to avoid
                        adblocker detections.
